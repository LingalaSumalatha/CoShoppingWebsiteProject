# CoShopping Website Project

This project is a part of my CSS learning process, where I have built a mock-up of an e-commerce website that includes various CSS features such as flex layouts, background images, hover effects, and responsive design using media queries.

## Project Overview

This is a simple web page that mimics an online shopping site, showcasing different product categories like furniture, electronics, stationery, and more. The design uses various CSS properties to style the navigation bar, search bar, product sections, and footer. Media queries are used to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.

### Features

- **Navbar:** A navigation bar with options like sign-in, returns, orders, and cart, styled with hover effects.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts according to screen size using CSS media queries for mobile and tablet devices.
- **Search Bar:** Includes a dropdown and input box, styled with icons.
- **Product Sections:** Displays product categories in boxes, each with background images, headings, and links.
- **Footer:** Contains multiple sections with links and a copyright notice, styled for a modern look.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For creating the structure of the website.
- **CSS3:** To style the webpage, including the use of flexbox for layouts, hover effects, and media queries for responsiveness.
- **Font Awesome Icons:** Used for the icons in the navigation bar and footer.
  
### How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Browse through the website layout and functionality.

### Learning Points

- **Flexbox Layouts:** Applied flexbox properties to align and space elements evenly, ensuring consistent design.
- **Hover Effects:** Added hover effects to buttons, links, and other elements to improve user experience.
- **Media Queries:** Implemented media queries to ensure responsiveness for mobile and tablet views.
- **Font Awesome Integration:** Used icons for navigation and other design elements.

### File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the webpage.

- `Images folder`: Contains images used for products and logo.

### Custom CSS Properties

- **Hover Effects:** Added hover effects to buttons, icons, and links to enhance interactivity.
- **Background Images:** Used background images for product categories with different styles such as `cover` and `no-repeat`.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and works on mobile devices by adjusting the layout through media queries.

### Future Improvements
